# intigration of a Python based 'stroop-task' with eye-tracking software

# This was my first python project at the UT
# The goal was to create a stroop taks, and integrate it with a DIY eye-tracker made from a cardboard box and a small camera
# I worked in a group with 3 other people
# Me and one other did most of the Python stuf
# the stroop task was made by us 
# The initial code that integrated eye-tracking software with a stroop-like task was made by our teacher M. Schmettow 
# However, as was asked in the assignment, we did edit this code so it would work with our DIY eye-tracker and to include our own stroop task



# (strooptask_group_21) -> our stroop task
# (yeti_14_group_21_challenge_2) -> our stroop task integrated with the eye trackers
